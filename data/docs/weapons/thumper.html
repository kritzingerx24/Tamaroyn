Thumper
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
The thumper is a direct-fire rocket that throws angular momentum
into its target, disorienting it.  The thumper causes only light damage.
<P>
To aid in hitting targets, the thumper is equipped with weak guidance
thrusters.  However, it is not fully guided, so you should be careful
to aim it at the target before firing.
