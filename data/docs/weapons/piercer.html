Piercer
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
The piercer is a direct-fire rocket that penetrates the target's
armor and shatters, causing medium damage.
<P>
To aid in hitting targets, the piercer is equipped with weak guidance
thrusters.  However, it is not fully guided, so you should be careful
to aim it at the target before firing.
