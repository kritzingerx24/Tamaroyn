Power Cell
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
An all-purpose energy source that generates power and
beams it to all nearby equipment.  Not all types of
equipment require external power, but you will find a
power cell essential to building a useful base.
<P>
Regardless of which army built a field unit, if it is neutral,
you can take control of it by powering it with your own
cell.  Conversely, if your own units lose power through
the cell's destruction, they will become neutral.
For this reason it is a good idea to employ backup power
sources.
<P>
A power cell can only supply energy to a limited number
of field units.  When you target a power cell, its energy
output is displayed as a horizontal bar just below the 
targeting reticle.
<P>
Two power cells cannot supply energy to overlapping regions
of space (otherwise they would overload each other and explode).
Therefore, if you tap a power cell to capacity, you will need
to construct another one nearby to power new field units.
<P>
Power cells will boost the repairing and refueling rates
of all vehicles within range.  This effect is limited
to one cell; two cells with overlapping ranges will not aid
a vehicle any more than one cell.  It is a good idea to
place energy cells in contested territory, as you will
have an advantage there.
<P>
The armor and fuel boost gained from a power cell is at its
highest when that cell is not expending energy powering base
structures; the bigger a base the cell powers, the less energy
remains to aid vehicles.
<P>
Due to their limited cloaking ability, enemy power cells are
difficult to spot on radar unless you have direct line of sight
or are very close to them.
