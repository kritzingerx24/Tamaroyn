Portal

</AUG>

A portal is a doorway between two locations in space, formed by
two devices that serve as endpoints.
<P>
Portals are often referred to as "the doors to independence" and
"the passage to the modern day", referring to the Independent
Party's landslide victory over the Coalition Government at the
<A HREF="background/cantero.html">Battle of Cantero in 2642</A>.
Most serious historians, however,
downplay the portal's role in the Revolutionary War, citing it
as one specific example of the general technological progress
that made the war's outcome inevitable.
<P>
At least one endpoint of a portal must be powered in order for 
friendly forces to pass through; and regardless of the state of
the destination endpoint, if the source point is controlled by
hostile forces, it will be impassable.
<P>
Because the two halves of a portal are connected by topological
isocontours, when one half is destroyed, the other end will collapse
and explode.
