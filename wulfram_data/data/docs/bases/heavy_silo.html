Fires very-long-range ballistic missiles at hostile installations.
These missiles, however, will usually be intercepted near the target
unless its defensive systems are otherwise occupied.  But when used
properly (as they so often have been), they can provide the extra 
impact necessary to turn the tide of battle.
