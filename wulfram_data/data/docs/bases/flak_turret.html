Flak Turret
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
A medium-range defensive weapon that fires exploding flak shells.
It is computer controlled, automatically tracking and firing at
potential threats.  As a safety precaution, the flak shells are
armed by a timer, and will not explode if they strike a target that
is too close.
<P>
Experience has shown that, though flak bursts can inflict impressive
damage, they can often be avoided by maneuverable craft.  Flak 
turrets are most effective when backed up by other types of firepower.
