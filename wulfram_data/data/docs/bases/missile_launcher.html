Missile Launcher
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
A long-range defensive unit that fires guided missiles at hostile targets.
<P>
Though the guided missiles have a long reach and are good at hitting
larger moving targets, they are not themselves effective anti-missile
systems, and require medium- and short-range guns for support.
During the Independent Party schism in 2647, a large battery of
undefended missile launchers were 
eliminated by a fleet of tanks hiding behind the rocky ridges of the New
Qumran, who fired guided missiles of their own.  Once the missile
sites were clear, the tanks moved in and won the day.
