Uplink
</TITLE>

Uplinks are used to communicate with supply ships.
<P>
Hit 'l' to target a friendly uplink.  Once you are holding
it, use the deploy key (".") to install it in your tank.
You'll see the uplink icon move to the left side of your
HUD.  Once the uplink is installed, you can go to the map
screen and order ships around.
<P>
You can order the supply ships to build new base units
(energy cells, repair pads, turrets and the like).  You can
also move them to more convenient positions.
<P>
Using the uplink to position supply ships properly, you can
destroy enemy supply ships and bombard enemy ground 
installations.
