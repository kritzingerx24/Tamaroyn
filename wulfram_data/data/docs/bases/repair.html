<TITLE>Repair Pad</TITLE>
</HEAD>
Nanoassemblers programmed with the precise physical structure of
each vehicle, repair pads can fix vehicles perfectly, restoring them down to
the last molecule.  Using the same technique, this pad can also build
vehicles from scratch.  This construction ability is one of the little
miracles that changed the world and made possible war as we know it.
<P>
To repair your vehicle, simply land on the pad.  The pad's automated
systems will do the rest.
