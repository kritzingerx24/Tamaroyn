Skypump
</TITLE>

Warp travel does bad things to the fabric of space, and the
gravitational ripples caused by warp effects can prevent further
warp-ins and destroy objects that are "native" to faraway space.
<P>
The skypump acts as a gravitational lens, creating a field of
stability that extends upward into orbit, effectively tuning
space to the same frequency as the space of your forces' origin
worlds.
<P>

When an area is stabilized by one skypump, supply ships will be able
to move through and occupy that space without being destroyed.  When
an area is stabilized by two or more skypumps, your home forces will
be able to warp in a new ship.
<P>

Because they act primarily as refocusers of existing energy, skypumps
are able to operate using internal batteries, so they do not require
external power.
