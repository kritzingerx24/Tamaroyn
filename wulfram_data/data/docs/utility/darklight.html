Darklight

Twists photons into their left-hand-universe counterparts, thus 
oozing a darkness that obscures units and renders them invisible
to radar.
<P>
The ability to throw around left-handed photons has been a child's toy
for centuries, but it is only during the past fiew decades that the
darklight has found practical utility in battle, due to a breakthrough
in photon-handling precision: now, by carefully modulating the
energy levels of emitted photons, the darklight is able to pulse in
a cryptographically secure sequence that can be filtered by friendly
forces, allowing them to see almost normally.
<P>
Since it primarily absorbs and re-emits existing light, the darklight
does not require external power.
