The New Social Contract

There was this thing called the Coalition Government, which through
the inertia of time had become this big agency that controlled
pretty much all of the civilized worlds that humanity had inhabited
(though most of the galaxy was still unexplored).
<P>
The Coalition Government was not excessively martial or imperialistic,
and neither was it too big-brotherish, though like all modern governments,
it had slight tendencies toward all three.
<P>
As a result of the general progress of technology, several things happened:
It became extremely cheap to make things, in general (such as weapons),
and maintenance costs became very low.  One of the things that it became
much cheaper to make was spaceships; though they still weren't exactly
cheap, they had become inexpensive enough that people besides the
government could afford to build large ones.
<P>
Because of the increased availabilities (and capabilities) of
interstellar transportation, there were suddenly places to go to that
nobody had been yet.  And the increased availability of military power
meant that if you went somewhere and decided that the Coalition 
Government wasn't allowed to tell you what to do, well, they couldn't
stop you without prohibitive expense.  And so they usually didn't try
to stop people until it became clear that this was happening enough to
really be a problem.
<P>
So I'm a little too tired to fill this all in now, but basically,
it goes like this: a big government holds everything together because
of the fine art of compromise: some people like abortion, some people
don't, so you take a stance in the middle somewhere and that becomes law.
But now anyone who cares enough about any major issue can go somewhere
where there are a whole lot of other people who feel the same way;
they don't have to settle for compromise.  So they do that.
<P>
Seeing the freedom that many are gaining just by leaving, subjects of
the Coalition Government become dissatisfied with the whole concept
of compromise; but they also don't want to uproot and move somewhere
else.  New political parties are formed, and factions become larger;
eventually they decide to split off from the main government in
big chunks.  The first such major defeat of the Coalition Government
was at <A HREF="background/cantero.html">Cantero</A>, where the
Independent Party captured the seat of power for an entire planet
(and soon, several more followed).
<P>
The Independent Party was soon rocked by scandal, and survived only
a few years before splitting up, in another warlike conflict.
The remains of the Coalition Government also suffered another civil
war, and then there were four main "parties", with the outerworlds'
ungoverned population always rising.  Technology kept advancing,
things kept getting easier, and political and religious factions
kept splitting and splitting.  Eventually we end up with more factions
than there are major planetary landmasses, each faction consisting of
people who believe in some major concept or ideal; all the known planets
are full, but most of the galaxy consists of unknown planets; every
group is hunting for a good one to call their own.
