The Battle That Looked Good On Paper
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
Eventually, when I get it written for real, there will be
a story of a battle here.  It is a concrete illustration, or
sampling, of
<A HREF="background/society.html">the point in time
at which society mutated</A>
into the game's "present day" situation,
and helps explain why there are a bunch of small groups of people
with tanks fighting over patches of land.
<P>
There was this thing called the Coalition Government, which through
the inertia of time had become this big agency that controlled
pretty much all of the civilized worlds that humanity had inhabited
(though most of the galaxy was still unexplored).
<P>
The Coalition Government was not excessively martial or imperialistic,
and neither was it too big-brotherish, though like all modern governments,
it had slight tendencies toward all three.  They were very concerned
about budget, and they cared very much about avoiding messy headlines.
<P>
There was this planet called Cantero, and on this planet were a very
large number of members
of the Independent Party who claimed that the local elections
for planetary governors had been fixed (in those elections, the 
Independent Party had lost very very badly).  The situation became
very tense when local Independent Party groups on Cantero began
building their own large-scale munitions.
<P>
The Coalition Government "quarantined" the offending Independent Party
areas (which were the size of small towns) and cut off their means of
supply.  They were building tanks and other offensive units, but all
visual evidence showed that it would take them months to manufacture
enough to be any real threat, and they would not last that long.
<P>
The Coalition took a very defensive stance: they surrounded their
important governmental centers with heavy defenses that would easily
shred any oncoming tanks.  The occasional minor attack would come, and
they would defeat it.  They never attacked the Independents, for fear
of bad publicity (the stories of "burning bodies of innocent civilians"
would be inevitable), and economics (when assaulting the enemy's bases,
they'd lose equipment and suffer casualties.  If they just wait, the
enemy would collapse).
<P>
The Coalition didn't know about <A HREF="portal.html">Portals,</A>
though, because they hadn't been invented yet.  And about one week
before their resources ran out, it became clear why the Independents
hadn't built very many tanks: inside big warehouses they'd been 
cranking out a number of portals.  They performed a tactic that became
known as a "portal rush": leave four or five portals half-set-up
(one end placed, the other end still in a box) and get one tank through
defenses into an enemy area, long enough to drop a portal.  Then you
have a gate inside, and the second guy flies through and drops his
other portal.  Repeat until you run out of portals; meanwhile your
other forces are flying through and smacking the energy units.
<P>
Using this tactic, for which the Coalition had been completely unprepared,
the Independents took control of all the planet's governmental centers
within three days.
