Caltrop
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
Caltrops are floating semi-guided explosive mines, usually released
in groups.  They will home in on enemy targets as a cloud of bombs.
Each caltrop causes only light damage, but they add up quickly.
<P>
Caltrops are especially useful when you are being chased by an enemy
and want to escape.  Caltrops have a lifetime of about 30 seconds;
after this time they will fall to the ground and explode.
