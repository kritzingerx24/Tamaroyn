</HEAD>
This is a light manned hovercraft.
<P>
The scout is less armored than the tank, but it moves more quickly.
It can carry fewer special armaments than the tank can.
<P>
The scout's main gun is a light version of the rapid-fire autocannon.
Its secondary gun is the Repair Beam, which can be used to repair
friendly units or strip armor from enemy units.  The Repair Beam has a range of
about 200 meters.
