Orignially way back in the day when glide and 3dfx where the top dog
on the block, and D3D was unstable and terrible, we implemented a
glide version for the rendering of the game.  It ran on varios
versions from the orignial VooDoo cards to the VooDoo 2 cards.

If you so choose, you can copy all the .dll files from this directory
into your main directory where the wulfram2 program is, and hope
things work okay.  They probably won't if you have a more recent 3dfx
card.

If you do the above, and things do not work, simply move glide2x.dll
and win32_glide.dll back into the 3dfx folder, and you'll be fine.

Voodoo3/4/5 suffer from texture misalignment problems in Wulfram II,
Voodoo4/5 cannot be fixed and you must use software mode (How to do so
is listed below). However, to fix voodoo3, you may use 1.03.05 driver
or under, 1.03.05 is linked below. (Warning: Any driver after 1.03.05
will not work, so getting the latest drivers will not fix this).

You can get the appropriate files from www.wulfram.com.  Simply search
for "Voodoo" and you'll be at the right place.
